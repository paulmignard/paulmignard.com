# A Thousand Steps and All That

This is the first post that I'm writing in @eleventy. I know I'm the last (or next to last) person to jump on this bandwagon but I'm going the full 100 yards here.

## Create a new blog in 2020

Use Github (I think? Do we still like github?) for source control
Use Netlify for CI and hosting
Blog about how awesome my new static site generator is
Post a perfect lighthouse score
Hate on Wordpress

All these points are true and sorry; I'm not going to hate on Wordpress. It doesn't work for what I want to do but it works for almost every one else and is a remarkably resilient piece of software. PHP is fine, MYSQL is fine, Apache is fine they're just not anything I want to mess with right now. 

Using github and netlify is pretty awesome. I've never contributed to open source software before so github is kinda new to me and hooking it up with netlify was almost trivial? I mean, they made it so easy I don't even really remember what I did; before I knew what was happening my site was published and deployed and everything was awesome.
